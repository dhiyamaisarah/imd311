For your information, me physically really active in playing netball in my high school era. I also have  a fantastic netball team in Sekolah Menengah gama Al-Islah. Every years i've always take part in this sport and participated in several tournaments before i finished school.The most powerful things I have learned at netball have been nothing at all to do with the game.
I’ve learnt that risks are good. No risk = no reward. I have learnt how to talk to large groups of people with varying levels of ability, from all walks of life.I have learnt that it’s OK to make mistakes, and that’s the best way to learn.I’ve learnt that having the right people around you is vital. A team doesn’t exist just for me to contribute to it.
